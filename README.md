# 〰️ Generative Art 〰️
This repository holds a collection of [generative art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_art "Generative Art Wiki") pieces I have worked on or am currently working on. The original inspiration came from a talk Tim Holman gave at CSSConf Australia (link [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Se0_w0ISYk&t=216s)). Each file contains a seperate piece and can be viewed by opening the index.html in a web browser. If you would like to modify any of the pieces go to the main.js file and make changes there. Thank you for taking an interest in my artwork.
